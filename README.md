# coffee-machine

#### This is a possible version for the [coffee machine project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/68?track=2) by [jetbrains academy/hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)

It is a simplified coffee machine sim, it asks the user what the want to do - buy a coffee, restock resources, etc. There are two versions in this repo, both having the same
functionality and only different in how they're written. [The final version of the project](https://github.com/immayankp/coffee-machine/blob/master/classy_coffee_machine.py) asked
for a refactor of the code which uses a coffee machine class with only one method processing any input that is entered in the machine.
